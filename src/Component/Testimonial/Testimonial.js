                                    We were looking for some additional storage to help protect the product and give us some additional capacityâ€¦ making sure we had that protection in the environment to satisfy our requirements. Great team to work with and everybody has been a pleasure to deal with.

                                    We came to them with a complicated project, but they handled it with ease. The experienced dock workers were able to sort and reload trucks with efficiency. The drivers were professional and prompt. We couldn't be more pleased with the customer service and would highly recommend DEPOT.
